                                At the prison, Finn met Sheila in the visitation area because she'd requested that he conduct her pre-trial exam. As he conducted the exam, he said it shouldn't take long. She quipped that she had no place to be. He asked if she'd had complications since the heart attack. She replied that she panicked whenever her heart raced. She assumed it was stress. Recalling that she could be dead, Sheila told Finn that he could have let her die, but he'd saved his mother's life.
                            </p>
                            <p class="py-2">
                                Finn reminded Sheila that he'd taken an oath not to harm, and he'd treated her like any other patient. Sheila insisted that she'd still never forget it. She said memories of Finn helped her sleep at night, and with her trial approaching, they helped her forget for at least a moment that she might never be a free woman again.
                            </p>

                                Finn checked Sheila's heart and noted that it was racing. Sheila said she was stressed, and her day of reckoning was approaching. She knew she couldn't escape it, and the thought of living without Hayes and Finn was too much. She said she knew what pain she'd caused Finn and his loved ones, but she loved him more than her own life.

                                Sheila wasn't proud of the choices she'd made and the people she'd hurt, but she was very proud that she'd given birth to Finn. Finn said he'd always be grateful for that, and he hoped she found a positive purpose for her life, even if behind bars. He told her that she was well enough to stand trial, and he'd be at the hearing. She said she'd see him one last time.

                                Finn turned to leave, but Sheila told him that no matter how long they'd been apart, the love was still there. She'd loved him from the moment he'd entered the world, and she had never stopped. She called him her beautiful baby boy and said she'd held him in her arms and stared at him for hours. She stated that it had been and still was the proudest moment of her life. She thanked God that Finn had chosen her as his mother.
                            </p>

                                Finn turned to leave again, but Sheila grabbed him and hugged him. Unable to fight the feeling, Finn dropped his medical bag and hugged her back. When they released each other, he said that when Sheila held him like that, it felt like something he'd been missing his whole life.

                                At Il Giardino, Liam was sullen as he glanced around at the happy couples dining together. He flashed back to marrying Hope and to signing the divorce papers. To his surprise, Steffy arrived, saying she'd been in the neighborhood. Liam said he hadn't expected to see her that day.

                                Prefacing that she didn't mean to pry, Steffy inquired about Liam and Hope. Liam said she wasn't prying, and he appreciated that she cared. Liam showed Steffy his left hand and said Hope had had divorce papers drawn up. Steffy was shocked to hear it and even more surprised that Hope thought her marital problems were due to Liam and Steffy's past together. Steffy concluded that Hope was pointing the blame at someone else for her own behavior.

                                Liam said he kind of agreed. He didn't fault Hope for not wanting to make her mom's mistakes. Steffy didn't think it justified harshly filing for divorce. Liam replied that it was a pretext. Liam said Hope wasn't wrong that he cared about Steffy and always would; however, he wasn't harboring any romantic delusions of a future with Steffy, and he respected her marriage. Liam said he wouldn't cross any lines or make that mistake again.
                            </p>
                            <p class="py-2">
                                Liam began to apologize again for the kisses, but Steffy said they'd known each other long enough. In her view, he didn't need to explain. She knew he'd been in pain and at a breaking point. She wanted to forget about it. Liam insisted on saying how much he respected Finn, who'd had to "transcend so much" with his psychopathic mother.
                            </p>
                            <p class="py-2">
                                Not wanting to talk about it, Steffy said Sheila was locked up and would stay there for life. Steffy asserted that Finn knew exactly who Sheila was, and after what she'd done to them, he'd never set eyes on her again.
